-----------------------

1) I installed prometheus into my k8s cluster by running `helm install stable/prometheus --namespace istio-system`
2) Ran `istioctl manifest apply --set profile=default --set values.prometheus.enabled=false` to install the istio components

-------------------
1) Installed prometheus via deployment YAML with sidecar injection using `istioctl kube-inject -f prometheus-deployment.yaml sudo kubectl apply -f -`
2) Create a prometheus svc/gw/vs/dr based on demo profile

---------------
1) Installed demo profile, the curl request trace didn't really help
2) Plan is to try to do this without the sidecar since it seems that the prometheus in the default profile doesn't have a sidecar installed
3) Installed prometheus configmap/deploy/svc 
4) Installed istio default manifest
5) Installed prom gw/vs/dr based on the demo profile
6) BINGO! IT worked
7) Works with sidecar too i guess
8) Need to work out config map next for prometheus to scrape
